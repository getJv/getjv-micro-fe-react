# React Micro Frontends with Vite

This repository is a sample project to show how to to build a simple micro frontends architecture.
I can read more in my [blog post]:https://dev.to/getjv/react-micro-frontends-with-vite-5442 or checkin my [slides talk](./docs/talk.pdf). 

# How to use this project

1. Check out this repo
2. Install dependencies [using pnpm][pnpm] `pnpm install` 
3. Start the development server using `yarn start` or `npm start`

**Extras:**

1. You can use plain `npm install` and `pnpm install` in each folder but that it will be a manual and boring task.
2. My video presenting the code: https://youtu.be/ymaPetOe6Zg
3. A video from [Jack Herrington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-nchkL9yIg&ab_channel=JackHerrington) there he shows more examples about how to use federation and mono-repo.
